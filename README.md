## Users
The platform is used with patients and health care providers who are able to login and access the following services;
1. The user/patient is able to search for and find 
health care providers in their area, based on factors such as specialty, location, and availability. 
2. The patient is able to schedule an appointment and the health care provider is able to confirm their availability.
3. Patients are able to view their medical records  including information such as past visits, medications, and allergies while health care providers can manage a patient's medical records, including updating visits, 
medications and allergies. 
4. Patients are able to view their health data, such as blood pressure, weight, and exercise activity.
5. Patients and providers are able to communicate through the platform.
6. Patients are able to rate the services of a health care provider

## Set Up
This application is created using node version `v16.17.1
`.
To get started;
```console
$ git clone git@github.com:Annastacia-dev/afyanet-react.git

$ cd afyanet-react

$ npm install

$ npm start

```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.

 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
